The files click_1.png click_2.png click_2.png are images the monitor will click on when detected on the screen.

For example, click_2 and click_3 are the hammer images that show in arena. Some bots don't click on these so
they stay on the screen forever. You can grab a screenshot of anything you want the monitor to click on, like
network errors etc, things which a bot won't click on or recognise.

The file change_name_to_use.png is just the American Dad captcha example, if it is the same size and resolution
of your emulator you can rename captcha1.png and use that.



If you need to create images/screenshots then I recommend this app, lightweight and easy to use...
